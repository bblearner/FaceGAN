# FaceGAN
Generating Faces using GAN

I tried using the tensorflow library to built a GAN model for generating digits and faces. The colab notebook can be found here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VHLChXB7dMaCutAnSPLC3BNvF1KkG7Tk?usp=sharing

I referred https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-train-a-progressive-growing-gan-in-keras-for-synthesizing-faces/ for data preparation and cleaning.
